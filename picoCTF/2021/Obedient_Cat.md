## Description

> This file has a flag in plain sight (aka "in-the-clear").
A file was attached.  

# Solution

After running `file` on the new download, we get the output:
```
flag: ASCII text
```
which means, we should be able to read it like a normal .txt. We run `less` on the file to view its content. We can then read the flag: `picoCTF{s4n1ty_v3r1f13d_2aa22101}`.
